Title: "Chapter 3 – Shadows on Campus"

A few hours passed. The clock hit quarter past nine, and the sky outside Tamika’s window darkened to an inky blue.

“Okay,” Tamika said, picking up the thread of their earlier talk. “Let’s suppose Claudia *did* kill her. Why would she still be hanging out with Renee like nothing happened?”

Michelle lay back on the bed, staring at the ceiling. “Sometimes things don’t make sense. Maybe it wasn’t even intentional. Could’ve been an accident.”

Tamika squinted at her, unimpressed. “We can’t accuse people just because you’re throwing around probabilities.”

Michelle smirked, rubbing her chin like a detective in a B-Grade movie. “Probability of Claudia killing Miss Natalie is low... but not zero.”

Tamika groaned. “We’ll discuss this tomorrow. After class. Right now, sleep.” She pointed toward her bed.

Michelle sat up. “I’ll just go back to my apartment. It’s late.”

“You’re not going anywhere.” Tamika folded her arms.

“I kind of have to. My clothes are there.”

“You can borrow mine. We’re the same height, same age, same waist. Problem solved.”

Michelle hesitated, then sighed. “Fine. But I’m grabbing my own stuff in the morning. First thing.”

Tamika giggled. “Deal.”

The next morning, Michelle’s alarm blared. She shook Tamika awake. “Come on, Timmy. Get dressed. We’re running.”

Toast in hand, they stepped outside, stopping in front of the empty driveway.

“Do we walk...” Tamika muttered, annoyed.

“Relax. We’ve got the scooter.” Michelle bit down on the last of her toast, muffled.

At the parking lot, Tamika suddenly stiffened. “Wait. Did you see that? Someone just... flashed us.” She squinted toward E-Wing.

Michelle tugged her away. “Spies or stalkers, who cares? I’m not giving anyone a show this early. Let’s go.”

Keys jingled. Minutes later, Michelle reappeared with the scooter. “Hop on. First stop, Biology department.”

“Fine. Meet me at the cafeteria at twelve sharp,” Tamika said as she jumped off at her building.

“Sharp. Got it.” Michelle saluted and sped off.

Campus bustled with life. By the time Michelle parked near A-Block, it was 11:45. She saw Tamika waving from the window, mouthing something impossible to understand.

A tap on Tamika’s head made her yelp. “Hey, I’m here,” Michelle said, grinning.

“You’re late,” Tamika pouted, folding her arms.

“Relax, it’s still technically morning,” Michelle teased. “So... class after this?”

“No.”

“Good. You’re coming with me then.”

“Where?” Tamika raised an eyebrow.

“Office first. Then math class. You’ll love it.”

The office was closed. Michelle sighed, dragging Tamika down the opposite hallway.

They passed a chalkboard scrawled with equations. Michelle froze.

“‘Solve for x’? That’s twelfth grade baby food. Why is this...?” Her voice trailed off.

Tamika frowned. “It’s just an equation, Mesh.”

“No. It’s wrong.” Michelle jabbed at the negative exponent. “That shouldn’t even be here.”

Tamika blinked. “Wait... what?”

Michelle rolled up her sleeves, grabbed the chalk, and rewrote the brackets. Within minutes, the solution unfolded across the board, neat and precise.

“There. Done.”

Tamika’s jaw dropped. “Ohhh. Now I get it.” She hugged Michelle proudly.

From the back, a student whispered, “How the hell did she just do that?” Others stared at the board like it was magic.

Michelle smirked. “It’s not magic. It’s math. Which is basically the same thing, but with less glitter.”

They walked away under the weight of those stares.

Michelle’s phone rang. She checked the screen, then softened. “Hey, Mama.”

On the other end, Halen Edward’s voice was warm but tired. “My darling, how are you? And Archie? Please tell me you two aren’t fighting.”

“We’re fine, Mama. Totally civilized. I promise.” Michelle bit her lip. “What about Dad?”

A long pause. “Your father... he’s been acting strange. Something happened between him and Archie. I don’t know what.”

Michelle frowned. “Don’t worry. I’ll handle it. I’ll call you later, Mama. Love you.” She hung up, sliding the phone back in her pocket.

Tamika rolled her eyes. “Quite interesting call. What were we supposed to talk about?”

Michelle tilted her head. “You tell me.”

“Not here. It’s not safe.” Tamika lowered her voice. “Later.”

“Fine. But hurry. We’re gonna be late.”

They entered B-Block’s mathematics department, walls lined with colorful posters.

Tamika squinted. “What are these weird equations?”

Michelle’s eyes lit up. She pulled Tamika closer like a tour guide.

“This one’s Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. That’s Ptolemy’s Theorem. Over there Euler’s Theorem. And my personal favorite, Fermat’s Last Theorem.”

She practically bounced on her toes. “I love these.”

Tamika shook her head, smiling. “You’re insane. But at least it’s the cute kind of insane.”

Michelle giggled. “Math is love. Math never cheats.”

And yet, behind them in the crowd, eyes were watching. Whispering. Recording.

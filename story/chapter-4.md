Title: "Chapter 4 – Threads Begin to Pull"

“Hey, sis. What ya doing?”

Michelle turned at the voice. Jenny, the twelfth grader from one floor below, bounced into the cafeteria with a grin. “I saw your solution on the chalkboard. You’re pretty good at this.”

Michelle pinched her cheek. “Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing here?”

Jenny clasped her hands together in mock prayer. “I need a favor. Please?”

Tamika, half-asleep and zoning out, blinked at them.

Michelle raised an eyebrow. “What kind of favor?”

“Be my project partner. I want to run for Math Club president, like you. But no one wants me in their group.” Her face fell dramatically, eyes wide with fake innocence.

Michelle chuckled. “Sure. It’ll be a pleasure.” She pinched her cheeks again.

Then her expression sharpened. “Now come on, Timmy. We need to find Claudia.”

Tamika snapped back to reality. “Wait, what? Why?”

“Because I need answers,” Michelle said flatly.

Jenny leaned in with a smile that was just a little too proud. “I can help. I know where she goes.”

Tamika scowled. “Why are you still here?”

Michelle tugged Jenny closer, lowering her voice. “And it’s not cute to spy on people.”

Jenny rolled her eyes. “I’m not spying. I just know everything. Claudia and Renee always go to YES Club on Wednesdays. It’s their ‘bestie night.’”

Michelle narrowed her eyes. “You’re not even old enough for that place.”

“I didn’t go. Martha told me.” Jenny’s tone was smug.

Tamika frowned. “And Martha is…?”

“My sister,” Jenny said proudly. “Programmer. Knows everything.”

“Hacker,” Michelle corrected.

“Programmer,” Jenny snapped back.

Tamika sighed. “Same thing.”

Michelle waved it off. “Fine. We’ll check. But first we change and regroup.”

Tamika yanked the scooter keys. “I’m driving.”

Michelle wiped her glasses on her shirt, calm despite Tamika’s glare. “We’ll ask Martha where it is. Chill.”

Tamika shot her a look. “You’re insane. We could get in real trouble.”

“Maybe. But maybe not.” Michelle tapped her shoulder, smirking.

They zipped past Timber-Crest, Michelle staring up at the sky. “Actually, Renee’s mom just died. They wouldn’t be out clubbing.”

Tamika slowed the scooter, eyes narrowing. “Wait. Look.” She pointed toward the town hall.

Michelle followed her gaze. Claudia and Renee were there, clutching a brown file.

“What the hell are they doing with that?” Michelle whispered.

“Doesn’t matter. Not now.” Tamika tugged her away.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Carroll: *Come home. Where are you?*

Tamika groaned. “I have to go. Carroll’s being bossy again.”

“Come on, just talk.” Michelle started.

But Tamika was already backing away. “Later, Mesh. Bye.” They hugged quickly before parting.

That evening, Michelle’s doorbell rang. She opened it to see Renee smiling, arms full of books and colorful pens.

“Hey, come in,” Michelle said warmly.

Renee waved politely at Archie, who was slouched on the couch. “Hi.”

Archie faked a smile. “Hi.”

Then he stood, stretching. “I’m heading out. Pizza money’s on my card.”

Michelle winced when he pinched her arm. “Ow. Fine, go.”

“Sorry about that,” she muttered as he left. “Sibling thing.”

“It’s okay,” Renee said softly. “Julian ignores me most of the time. At least Archie likes you.”

Michelle snorted. “He only *pretends* in front of people. Anyway, coffee or tea?”

“Black coffee, please.”

Michelle returned with two cups, setting one in front of Renee. “So. Books. Pens. Spill.”

Renee smiled shyly. “Math test tomorrow. I’m hopeless with theorems. I was hoping you could help.”

Michelle grinned, already flipping through the pages. “Of course. Look... this is quadratic reciprocity. It’s easier than it looks. Watch.”

She crossed her legs on the couch, walking Renee through the proof step by step. Renee leaned closer, watching every movement.

By the time they finished, the clock read 7:30. Three empty coffee cups sat between them.

Michelle pushed her glasses up. “What about Claudia? She’s in your class too, right?”

Renee blinked. “Claudia? Who?”

“Claudine Wallace,” Michelle clarified.

“Oh... Cal. She doesn’t care about grades. I’ll help her tomorrow.” Renee sighed.

Michelle studied her, unreadable. “Right. Well, thanks for stopping by.”

Renee smiled, gathering her books. “See you later.”

Michelle shut the door, leaning against it for a moment.

But outside, the night wasn’t quiet.

Near the taped-off crime scene, a woman in a hood leaned down, searching the ground with frantic eyes. Her hair was streaked blonde and brown, falling into her face.

“Where the hell did that brooch go?” she muttered. “It has to be here. I can’t let the police find it.”

Her fingers clawed at the dirt. Empty.

She cursed under her breath, straightened, and melted back into the shadows.

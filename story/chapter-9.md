Title: "Chapter 9 – The Intruder"
---

The blackout pressed against them like a suffocating blanket. No one moved. The only sound was their ragged breathing and the faint scrape of footsteps coming closer, deliberate and slow.

“Who’s there?” Renee’s voice cracked.

No answer.

Claudia’s wine glass shattered as she fumbled in the dark. “This isn’t funny!” she shouted, but her tone betrayed fear more than anger.

Michelle’s hand searched blindly across the table until her fingers brushed the cold metal of a candlestick holder. She gripped it tight, raising it like a weapon.

Then the footsteps stopped. Silence.

A sudden flash lit the room, blinding for a split second. Michelle flinched, realizing someone had just taken a photograph.

“Shit,” Tamika hissed. “Someone’s spying on us.”

Before panic could spiral, the lights hummed back to life.

And there, by the archway leading to the back door, stood a man in a black leather coat. His face was partly shadowed by the brim of his cap. A camera dangled from his hand.

“Who the hell are you?” Claudia snapped, standing as if to shield Renee.

The man lifted his chin, revealing himself. “Bob,” he said simply.

The name struck a chord. Claudia had mentioned him before, the town’s security in-charge, the one with connections to Julian’s university.

“What are you doing here?” Michelle demanded, still clutching the candlestick.

Bob smirked faintly. “Doing my job. Making sure Crest stays safe. You four are stirring trouble, poking your noses into things better left buried.”

“That doesn’t explain why you’re sneaking photos of us like some creep,” Tamika shot back, arms crossed.

Bob’s expression didn’t change. He glanced at Renee, his tone chilling. “Ask yourself... why did your mother die? Do you really think it was random? People are lying to you, even in this room.”

Renee stiffened, her eyes darting between Michelle and Claudia.

Michelle swallowed hard. “What are you implying?”

Bob pocketed the camera, his boots heavy on the wooden floor as he walked closer. “I’m implying that the killer isn’t far from you. And the longer you pretend otherwise, the more dangerous it gets.”

The girls exchanged tense glances. The villa’s atmosphere, already suffocating, grew heavier.

Then Bob leaned closer to Michelle, his voice dropping low. “And you, little genius... maybe stop throwing away evidence if you don’t want the wrong people to hang for this.”

Michelle froze. He knew about the brooch. Her heartbeat skipped.

Before anyone could react, Bob turned sharply and left through the back door. The creak of hinges echoed long after he was gone.

Silence filled the villa once more.

Claudia broke it first, slamming her fist on the table. “See? He’s playing you. He’s trying to pin this on me!”

Renee’s voice shook. “But why would Bob know about the brooch? Only you and Michelle...” She trailed off, confusion pulling her in both directions.

Tamika reached for Michelle’s hand under the table, whispering so only she could hear: “Mesh, he knows too much. Either he’s the killer... or he’s covering for the one who is.”

Michelle didn’t answer. Her mind was spinning. Bob’s words clung to her like poison: *The killer isn’t far from you.*

And for the first time, Michelle wondered, was it someone in this very room?

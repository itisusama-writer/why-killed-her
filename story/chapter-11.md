Title: "Chapter 11 – The Watcher"
---

The next morning, Michelle, Tamika, Claudia, and Renee sat hunched around the same laptop. The email still glowed on the screen like a taunt.

**“You’re getting warmer.”**

“Warmer?” Claudia scoffed. “That’s a game. Whoever this is, they’re toying with us. And if it’s Bob, he’s laughing right now.”

“Unless it’s not Bob,” Tamika muttered, crossing her arms. “What if it’s one of us?”

That froze the room.

Michelle’s pen slipped from her fingers. Renee’s jaw tightened. Claudia’s smirk vanished.

“Don’t start,” Michelle said, her voice sharper than intended.

“I’m not starting anything,” Tamika shot back. “I’m saying if Bob really wanted to expose you, Mesh, why not go straight to the cops? Why send creepy messages?”

“Because he’s manipulating us,” Michelle insisted. “He wants us paranoid. Distracted.”

Renee slammed her palm on the table. “Then let’s stop arguing and prove it. We follow him. Tonight.”

By late afternoon, the girls were parked across the street from the **Crest Security Office**, Claudia behind the wheel. Bob’s car sat in the lot, dull under the fading sun.

“He doesn’t know we’re watching?” Tamika asked nervously.

“Not unless he’s got cameras everywhere,” Claudia muttered. “Which he probably does.”

At 6:05 sharp, Bob stepped outside, locked his office, and slid into his car. The girls exchanged quick glances.

“Showtime,” Renee whispered.

They trailed him at a cautious distance. Bob drove with unnerving precision, never speeding, never hesitating. It was as if he knew he was being followed.

Finally, he pulled into the quiet lot behind **Timber Hall**, the old university building.

“What’s he doing here?” Michelle whispered.

Bob got out, carrying a leather satchel. He glanced once over his shoulder, then disappeared inside the dimly lit building.

The girls slipped out of the car. Their footsteps echoed in the empty corridors of Timber Hall, the air heavy with dust and abandonment.

“He came this way,” Claudia whispered, pointing at faint light leaking under a classroom door.

Inside, Bob sat at a desk, tapping on a laptop. Rows of old filing cabinets surrounded him. On the screen, lines of code scrolled fast.

“Is he… hacking something?” Renee breathed.

A sudden *click*. Michelle flinched. The sound wasn’t from Bob’s laptop, it was behind them.

A camera flash.

“Shit,” Tamika hissed, spinning around, but the hallway was empty.

Bob’s head jerked up at the noise. He slammed his laptop shut and strode toward the door.

“Run!” Claudia grabbed Michelle’s wrist, dragging her down the hall. They bolted into the night, lungs burning.

Back in the car, Renee clutched the polaroid photo she still carried like a lifeline. Her voice shook.

“Someone’s watching us, Mesh. Not just himsomeone else.”

Michelle’s hands trembled on her lap. “And they want me to take the fall.”

Claudia turned, eyes narrowed. “Or maybe you already did something worth hiding.”

The words landed like a slap.

Michelle’s face drained of color. “You don’t really believe that…”

Renee’s silence was worse than any answer.

Michelle’s phone buzzed again. A new email.

This time, an image file.

It was the four of them huddled in the hallway of Timber Hall.
Taken just minutes ago.

The subject line read:
**“Closer.”**

Title: "Chapter 6 – The Footprints"
---

The café smelled of roasted beans and burnt sugar. Michelle stared into the swirl of her black coffee, her mind spiraling in calculations that couldn’t help her this time. Across from her, Renee cracked her knuckles loudly, her voice trembling.

“Whose footprints are these? Who killed my mom and why?” she whispered, half to herself, half to the world.

Before anyone could reply, the café door chimed. A tall man in a black leather coat walked in, followed closely by Inspector Melanie Hogan.

“Hello, Dave. Welcome to our town,” the old cashier lady said with a polite smile. “Did you find Natalie’s killer?”

“Almost, ma’am,” Detective Dave Neville replied, forcing a smile as his cold eyes swept the room. “We are too close to that footprints girl.”

Claudia froze mid-sip. *The footprint girl?* The words struck her like ice water.

“Who’s that lady?” Dave muttered, nodding toward the cashier.

“She is Miss Francine, the owner’s wife,” Melanie whispered back.

Claudia’s thoughts raced. *Footprints? Girl? Could it be Michelle?*

The clock on the café wall ticked mercilessly toward half past five. Dave and Melanie huddled together at their table, tapping on a bulky tablet, exchanging quiet words. None of the girls dared to linger. Renee and Claudia hugged lightly outside, then walked off in opposite directions as the sun dipped into golden hour.

Later that night, Michelle let the hot shower run over her face, but the steam couldn’t wash away the panic. Her chest tightened, breath short, her pulse rattling in her ears. *The email. The photos. The video.*

“Mesh?” Tamika’s voice called from the apartment.

Michelle stepped out, dripping, clutching a towel around her shoulders. Her eyes looked wild.

“Why are you acting so weird?” Tamika frowned, concerned.

“See this.” Michelle thrust her phone into Tamika’s hands.

Tamika scrolled. “So… what am I supposed to see?”

“Open the attachment from madmax.”

The images flickered on screen. Tamika went silent. Her lips parted as her face drained of color.

“How… how did he get this?”

“That’s not the question!” Michelle snapped, pacing the room. “The question is how do we get out of this.”

Both of them sat frozen, paralyzed in thought, their silence louder than the traffic outside. Finally, Michelle grabbed her jacket.

“Come on. Let’s go to the park. I need air.”

The night was cool, the park lamps humming faintly. They wandered aimlessly until Tamika’s sharp tug on Michelle’s sleeve broke the silence.

“Mesh. Look.”

On a bench ahead, Renee and Claudia whispered intensely, heads close.

Michelle’s stomach twisted. “Let’s talk to her.”

“Talk to *who*?” Tamika hissed, dragged unwillingly.

“Renee.”

Michelle approached, voice trembling. “Can we talk?”

“Okay,” Renee said warily, squinting. Michelle led her to another bench, while Tamika sat stiffly beside Claudia.

“I saw your mother’s body,” Michelle whispered. “I was there. And I found… Claudia’s brooch. With blood on it.”

“What?” Renee’s voice cracked.

“Are you insane?” Claudia shot up, furious.

“Did you kill my mom? Yes or no,” Renee asked, her face reddening.

“It is obvious no!” Claudia’s words came sharp. “Why would I kill her?”

Renee stood, tears glinting in her eyes. “Then who?” She walked away into the dark. Claudia bit her lip, glaring at Michelle, then stormed off in the opposite direction.

The next day, the cafeteria buzzed with whispers. Renee slammed her tray down in front of Claudia.

“If you weren’t there, how did your brooch end up by my mother’s body? Did it grow legs and walk there?”

“How can you believe that… that girl?” Claudia spat, her eyes cutting across the hall.

“Tamika showed me her messages.” Renee’s voice shook. “You better leave, now.”

Claudia’s nostrils flared. *I’m going to kill her,* she thought, storming out.

A week later, silence had settled like ash. Renee skipped classes, locking herself away. Doubt gnawed at her: *What if Claudia didn’t do it? What if someone framed her?*

In the cafeteria, Michelle sipped her black coffee while Tamika flipped pages of a thick biology text. Michelle scribbled on Jenny’s theorem notes, trying to distract herself.

Suddenly, a hand grabbed her hair and slammed her forehead against the table. Pain exploded, and blood trickled from her nose.

“Claudia!” Tamika gasped.

Michelle whimpered, “Ouch…”

“What is wrong with you?!” Tamika shouted, eyes wide.

Claudia leaned in, rage blazing. “What’s my problem? You set Renee against me! You blame me for something I didn’t do!”

“I told her the truth,” Michelle winced, holding a tissue to her nose. “I found your brooch near the body.”

Claudia’s face twisted. “Now I get it. You staged everything, didn’t you? You killed her… and now you’re framing me.”

She turned, halfway to the door, then pivoted back, voice trembling with fury. “Yes, those footprints… they’re yours. And I’m going to Renee first.”

The door slammed behind her.

Tamika and Michelle locked eyes. Both pale, both confused.

“Wait. What? Footprints?” Tamika whispered.

“Hers,” Claudia’s voice echoed in memory.

Michelle sat back, still pressing her bleeding nose. “Do you think… she’ll go to the police?”

Tamika’s voice wavered. “Don’t. Please don’t start your probabilities again. She won’t. She can’t. Believe me.”

But Michelle wasn’t convinced.

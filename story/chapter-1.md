Title: "Chapter 1 – Introduction"

Michelle pressed her palms against the glass doors and stumbled out of the bank, sucking in a deep breath like she’d just escaped a prison.

“Finally… air that doesn’t smell like moldy registers and sweaty clerks,” she muttered, tugging her bag higher on her shoulder. The bank was old, the only one in their small town, and smelled like paper rot. But today it gave her what she needed: a loan.

A loan to chase math. Equations. Theorems. Proofs. The kind of future that, in Michelle’s eyes, was the only thing worth worshiping.

Her stomach growled. Thinking about integrals on an empty stomach? Impossible. She hurried back to her apartment, silently praying well, not *praying*, because Michelle didn’t do God that her brother Archie had cooked something edible.

She swung the door open and froze.

“Salad. Again.”

Archie looked up from the counter, smug. “Healthy. You should be thanking me.”

Michelle glared. “Healthy? Bro, if you serve me one more bowl of rabbit food, I swear I’ll apply my math degree to calculate the perfect trajectory to throw it back in your face.” She grabbed her bag again. “I’m out.”

“If you leave now, you get nothing!” Archie called after her.

“Perfect. Nothing tastes better than your salad.”

She slammed the door and marched down the street.

Instead of Tamika’s place, Michelle ended up at **Timber-Crest Café**, a half busy corner joint that smelled of burnt espresso and sugar frosting. She downed juice and demolished three strawberry cupcakes before a sharp tap on her shoulder broke her rhythm.

She turned.

Claudia Wallace.

“Why are you forcing yourself between us?” Claudia’s voice was low but laced with venom.

Michelle blinked. “Excuse me?”

“You know damn well Renee’s my best frined. Stay away from her. You are brainwashing her.”

Michelle set her glass down, calm but sharp. “Claudia, listen. Renee is just my friend. Like Tamika. There’s no ‘between’ to get into. And I am not brainwashing her.”

Claudia’s eyes burned. “Oh yah... If I ever see you near her again... I’ll kill you.”

She stormed off, heels clicking like daggers.

Michelle let out a breathless laugh, shaking her head. “Great. Cupcakes, math loans, death threats. What a day.”

She turned toward the door, hand on the handle only to find someone else pushing it open.

**Tamika.**

Her best friend stood there, sad eyed, glasses missing, looking like she’d left half her soul back home.

“Timmy,” Michelle said softly. “Why the baby face?”

“Being a single sister with two jobless brothers is hell.” Tamika’s voice was flat.

Michelle pulled her inside before she could protest, guiding her to a table. “Where are your glasses? You blind walking now?”

Tamika smirked faintly and caught a spider crawling toward Michelle, trapping it under her water glass. “See? Perfect vision.”

Michelle laughed. “Touché.”

Over black coffee, Tamika sighed. “Carroll’s driving me insane. Don’t read too much, wear this, wear that, have fun, stop being a nerdy bitch. He’s bossy about everything.”

Michelle tilted her head, teasing. “Aww, he cares. Overbearing, but still. Better than Archie.”

Tamika shook her head. “No. He’s worse.”

Michelle reached for her hand but Tamika pulled away, expression unreadable.

Later, walking back toward Fay-Crest, Michelle spotted the park and dragged Tamika in. “Come on, sit. Breathe. Life’s too short to keep sulking.”

They sat under the dimming sky, talking about **Miss Natalie’s divorce** and the gossip surrounding the Moyers. Michelle threw theories around, half amused, half curious, while Tamika gave her quiet, careful answers.

“Sometimes life plays with you,” Tamika whispered. “You plan one thing, and something else breaks you. It’s all God’s plan.”

Michelle snorted. “You know me, Timmy. My only god is Math. It never cheats.”

Tamika smiled faintly. They always had this push and pull faith versus proof, warmth versus wit. It was what made them inseparable.

By the time they split ways, night had crept in. Michelle was only a few blocks from home when she noticed it.

Something shiny.

Near a garbage bag wedged between two buildings.

Curiosity tugged. Her brain screamed *ignore it*, but her feet moved closer anyway.

The shine was a **golden brooch.** Initials engraved: **C.W.** Claudia Wallace. The corner was smeared with blood.

Michelle’s chest tightened.

Then she saw them. **Green heels. Bloodstained.**

Her breath hitched. She staggered back, pulse racing.

“Oh my God...”

But no. Michelle didn’t believe in God. Only in numbers.

She turned and bolted toward her apartment, her hands trembling.

Archie was waiting inside, arms crossed. “You’re late. I’ve been waiting all day.”

Michelle brushed past him. “Not now. Not tonight.”

She shut her door, heart pounding in her ears.

And for the first time, Michelle didn’t want to think about math. She wanted to forget the brooch. Forget the blood.

But she couldn’t.

Because life had just changed. And she knew it.

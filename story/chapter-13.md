Title: "Chapter 13 – The Midnight Truth"
---

The Wallace Villa looked different at midnight.

It wasn’t the grand, sunlit estate it had been in daylight. Now it was a husk, its high windows black, the gates groaning like they hadn’t been opened in years. The garden lights were out. The place breathed shadows.

Michelle, Tamika, Claudia, and Renee stood together at the iron gates, none of them speaking. Each of them had read the same email. Each of them knew this was a trap. And yet… they had come.

“Last chance,” Tamika whispered. “We turn back now, forget this, and let the police handle it.”

“No,” Renee said, her jaw set. “Whoever killed my mom wants us here. And I’m done running.”

They pushed the gates open, the metal screeching against the silence, and stepped inside.

The living room lights were already on. A table sat in the center, a single lamp burning, casting the rest of the villa in eerie half-darkness.

On the table: four envelopes. Each labeled with their names.

Michelle opened hers. Inside, another photo her holding the brooch, mid-run. Claudia’s contained her sealed record. Renee’s was more vicious: a torn page from her mother’s diary, scrawled with: *“I don’t know how much longer I can hide this.”*

Tamika’s envelope had only one thing. A photo of her brothers. Crossed out in red ink.

Her hand shook. “This is sick.”

The sound of heels echoed from the hallway.

All four girls turned.

A figure stepped into the lamplight.

Tall. Composed. Eyes that held both exhaustion and fire.

**A woman.**

She tossed a phone onto the table. The same phone that had been sending Michelle the blackmail messages.

“You wanted the truth,” she said coolly. “Here it is.”

Renee froze. “Who… who are you?”

The woman’s gaze flicked to her. Then softened, almost pitying. “You’ve seen me before, child. Just not like this.”

Claudia narrowed her eyes. “Wait...”

Michelle’s breath caught in her throat. The resemblance was faint but there. The curve of her jaw. The way her voice dipped at the end of each sentence.

“You were having an affair,” Michelle whispered. “With Mr. Moyer.”

The woman’s smile was razor-thin. “And now… I’m the only one who knows what really happened to Natalie.”

The silence that followed was suffocating.

Renee staggered back, her chest tightening. “No… no, that’s not possible.”

The woman leaned on the table, her eyes glittering. “Ask yourself why your mother died. Do you really think it was random?”

The air in the villa seemed to collapse around them. For the first time, the Watcher had a face. And it wasn’t Bob. It wasn’t some faceless man in a hoodie.

It was her.

The one who had been inside their lives all along.

And now finally the truth was standing right in front of them.

The lamp flickered once.

And in the half-dark, the woman’s voice cut through the silence.

**“Do you want to know why she had to die?”**

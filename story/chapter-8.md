Title: "Chapter 8 – Shadows in the Villa"
---

The Wallace Villa loomed like a dark monument at the edge of Crest. Michelle and Tamika stood at the front gate, exchanging nervous glances as the last of the golden hour bled into deep blue. Renee pulled the door open before they could knock, her face pale, her eyes carrying shadows of sleepless nights.

“Come in,” she said quietly.

The villa’s silence was unnerving. No servants. No family. Only the four girls and the heavy echo of their footsteps as they entered the grand living room. Claudia was already on the couch, swirling wine in her glass like it was part of a ritual.

“Welcome,” she smirked. “Finally decided to stop running.”

The atmosphere felt strange—stale air, half-drawn curtains, the faint ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner. Michelle shifted uneasily.

“All right,” Renee broke the silence, her voice sharper than usual. “Tell me everything. No lies. No games.”

Michelle opened her mouth, but before a word left, the lights flickered. once, twice, then went out. Darkness swallowed the villa.

“What the hell?” Tamika gasped.

“Calm down. It happens sometimes. Old wiring,” Claudia muttered, but her voice trembled despite the smirk she tried to maintain.

From upstairs came the sound of wood creaking, slow, deliberate, as if someone was walking across the floor.

Renee’s face drained of color. “There’s no one here but us... right?”

The lights blinked back to life. Dust motes danced in the sudden glow, as if the villa itself had been holding its breath.

Michelle’s heart pounded, but she forced herself to speak. “On the night of the murder, I was heading home. I found a garbage bag near E-Wing. Inside... your mother’s body. And near it... Claudia’s brooch. With blood on it.”

“You liar!” Claudia slammed her glass down, red wine spilling like blood across the table. “You planted it, didn’t you?”

Tamika grabbed Michelle’s arm to calm her down. “No, she didn’t. I saw the brooch too. She threw it away later, but she didn’t lie about finding it.”

“Convenient,” Claudia hissed, eyes narrowing. “Always pointing at me.”

Before anyone could answer, the ticking clock in the corner stopped. A hollow silence filled the room. Then came three slow knocks on the villa’s back door.

All four girls froze.

Renee whispered, “No one knows we’re here.”

Michelle stood up, her legs shaking but her voice steady. “Then someone’s watching us.”

Claudia’s smirk finally cracked. For the first time, she looked afraid.

The lights flickered again... and this time, the villa plunged into pitch black.

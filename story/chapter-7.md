Title: "Chapter 7 - The Discussion"
---

Michelle and Tamika returned to Crest with a quiet sense of relief. The air carried the faint smell of rain, as if the town itself was holding its breath. Tamika’s phone buzzed the moment they pulled into the lot.

She frowned at the screen.
“Mesh, listen to this. Reed and Carroll texted me... they’re out with Archie on some trip, and apparently, they took the apartment keys with them.”

Michelle pulled off her helmet and raised a brow. “What do you mean they took the keys?”

Tamika tilted her phone for her to see. *You’ll have to stay with Michelle for a few days. Archie is with us if she hasn’t gotten his message. Luv ya, BYE.*

Michelle sighed and dug out her flip phone from her bag. Sure enough, Archie’s text was waiting: *Hey Michelle! Daddy called me last night, so I had to leave. You and Tamika will have to share the room. Keys are with Martha if you need them.*

“Of course,” Michelle muttered. “Always dropping surprises like this.”

“Guess I’m your new roommate,” Tamika teased with a small grin.

They climbed the stairs to Michelle’s apartment, but the moment the door swung open, both froze. Cups, plates, half-empty bottles, and greasy pizza boxes littered the counter and floor. Crumbs stained the couch cushions.

Michelle’s nose wrinkled. “Archie didn’t mention this disaster. Now I’m supposed to clean it all up.”

Tamika smirked and rolled up her sleeves. “My brothers make the same mess. I’ll help you. But first... let’s go change. No way I’m scrubbing in these clothes.”

Michelle cracked a grin. “Deal.”

The next morning, the sun cut through a thin veil of clouds as they arrived at campus earlier than usual. Michelle’s nerves were tight, her eyes darting across the walkways.

“I have to talk to them,” she said abruptly.

“To who?” Tamika adjusted her backpack.

“Claudia. Renee. I need to clear this mess before it gets worse. I didn’t kill Miss Natalie.” Michelle’s voice came louder than she intended, drawing glances from a passing group of students.

Tamika quickly tugged her by the shoulder. “Keep it down! You’ll make everyone think you did.”

Michelle pressed her lips together and said nothing more.

They spent most of the day wandering across campus cafeteria, library, lecture halls, hoping to spot Claudia and Renee. But hours slipped by with no success. By afternoon, both felt drained.

“Forget it,” Tamika muttered, shoulders slumping. “They’re avoiding us.”

Michelle stared down at her fingernails, chewing on one nervously. “Maybe I should call one of them?”

“No,” Tamika said firmly. “Let’s just leave.”

They were almost at the parking lot when a voice rang out.

“Michelle!”

Both girls turned to see Claudia and Renee striding toward them. Renee held something in her hand, a polaroid photograph. Her expression was cold.

Claudia’s glare was sharper. Without a word, she flung the photo into Michelle’s face. “What is this? And don’t you dare tell me it’s not yours.”

Michelle blinked, stunned. The photo fluttered to the ground. Tamika bent down, picked it up, and froze.

“What is it?” Renee asked sharply.

Tamika studied it closer, her voice calm but cutting. “These footprints… they’re from heels. Michelle’s never worn heels in her entire life.”

Michelle’s eyes widened. “Exactly. So how could...”

“Oh, please,” Claudia interrupted, frustration flaring in her tone.

Renee’s gaze bounced between them, her grip tightening on her bag. “So first she blamed you, Claudia, and now you’re saying it wasn’t hers? Do you think I’m stupid?”

“I’m telling the truth,” Michelle said, her voice trembling but steady. “Why would I lie?”

Tamika raised her hands. “We shouldn’t be standing here arguing. We all look suspicious enough just huddled in a parking lot. We can sort this later.”

Claudia tilted her head, her lips curling into a smirk. “Fine. Tonight. My place. Wallace Villa. We’ll settle this.”

Michelle and Tamika glanced at each other uneasily as Renee clutched the photo tighter. The sky above was already slipping into shades of gold and red, the night creeping closer.

What awaited them at Wallace Villa?

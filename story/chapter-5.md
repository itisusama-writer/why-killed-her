“Why were you there?”

Cal’s voice was sharp enough to cut.

Renee blinked, caught off guard. “Where? And why are you shouting at me?”

“Don’t play dumb with me.” Cal’s lips curled, her nostrils flaring. “Yesterday I saw you slipping out of Crest. And today you’re all chummy with Michelle, thanking her for something.”

Renee fumbled with her words. “I... I was… You know we had a math test today. I was at Michelle’s place yesterday. Just for help.”

“The whole day?” Cal pressed.

“No. Only two hours. That’s all.” Renee rubbed her chin nervously.

Cal’s eyes narrowed. “You know what we’re working on. And you still went there. Did you tell her anything?”

Renee’s voice softened. “No. I didn’t say a word. I promise.”

Cal exhaled slowly, the fire in her tone cooling to embers. “Good. Be careful next time.”

Across town, Michelle and Jenny sat cross-legged on the floor of Michelle’s apartment, locked in a duel of mental math. Scratch paper was scattered around like snow.

The doorbell rang three sharp times.

Michelle jumped up, adjusting her glasses. “Coming!”

She opened the door to find Martha standing there, arms crossed.

“Hey, Martha,” Michelle greeted with a smile.

“Jenny. Move it. We have to leave,” Martha barked.

“Where?” Michelle asked as she let her in.

“Uncle Jack’s,” Martha replied, her eyes flicking to the TV in the corner. The Crest murder case dominated the news again. *The investigation stalls, but Detective Dave Neville reports fresh evidence: footprints near the victim’s body.*

Martha lowered her voice. “They’ve got a lead.”

Jenny scrambled for her backpack. “Coming!”

Martha lingered at the door. “If you ever need help... computer stuff, information... call me.”

Michelle nodded with a forced smile. “Thanks. Take care.”

The sisters disappeared down the stairwell.

Later that morning, Michelle knocked on Tamika’s door at C-Wing, biting her lip. Reed opened it.

“She’s inside. Still half-asleep.”

Michelle found Tamika yawning in bed.

“Why didn’t you answer my calls?” Michelle demanded, squinting at her.

“My phone died. Sorry.” Tamika stretched. “Why? Did you find something again?”

Michelle hesitated, lowering her voice. “I’m not stupid. I threw the brooch away. Somewhere near E or F-Wing.”

Tamika guided her to sit. “Good. Now tell me why you came here this early.”

“It’s ten a.m., not early. And… Dave Neville is on the case.”

Tamika blinked. “Who?”

“Dave. From the Flamingo murder case,” Michelle said firmly.

A picture of him surfaced in her mind: six-foot-three, short blond hair, rigid posture. A man of strict habits, home at six sharp, same breakfast every day. Father of three, devoted Christian, feared by suspects for his ruthless suspicion. In the Flamingo case, he had arrested six innocent animal caretakers, just to test their alibis.

Tamika’s eyes widened. “That Dave?”

Michelle nodded grimly. “That Dave.”

By noon, they sat at Timber-Crest Café.

“Black coffee,” Michelle told the waiter.

“Mocha and blueberry toast,” Tamika added with a faint smile.

As they waited, Tamika leaned in. “Mesh, why are you so nervous? You haven’t done anything wrong.”

Michelle drummed her fingers on the table. “Dave doesn’t care. He hunts suspicion like it’s math to solve.”

Before Tamika could answer, the door chimed. Claudia and Renee entered.

Tamika nudged her. “Look. They’re here.”

Renee waved softly at Michelle. Michelle waved back. Claudia, however, grabbed Renee’s arm, yanking her toward another table.

“What is her problem?” Tamika muttered.

Michelle smirked bitterly. “She thinks I have an affair with Renee.”

Tamika smirked. “Well, are you?”

Michelle rolled her eyes. “Stop. My only love is math.”

They laughed softly, but it didn’t last.

Michelle’s phone vibrated with a new email. Sender: *[madmax0142@insertswork.net](mailto:madmax0142@insertswork.net).*

She opened it.

Inside was a single line:

*I saw you and your partner kill her. I have proof.*

Attached were photos and a video.

Michelle’s fingers trembled as she tapped.

The screen filled with grainy footage: herself, near the garbage bags the night of the murder, bending down, reaching for the brooch. Stills of her shocked face under the streetlight. Her hand clutching the golden “C.W.” initials.

But the worst part wasn’t her.

In one of the photos, blurred but visible, Tamika’s silhouette stood in the background watching.

Michelle’s blood ran cold. Her throat locked.

“What is it?” Tamika asked, shaking her shoulder. “Mesh, what happened?”

Michelle couldn’t speak. Her lips parted, but only a whisper came out.

“They… were watching us.”

Michelle shut her phone, clutching it so tight her knuckles turned white. Her eyes flicked somewhere beyond the café walls, past the chatter, past the world itself.

“So I was the first girl,” she whispered, half to herself, half to someone else unseen. “And from here… you got the crazy idea of torturing girls. This brooch was your first jewelry piece... Luckily, I didn’t get the bangle thing.”

Tamika leaned closer, frowning. “Mesh, are you okay? Who are you talking to?”

Michelle forced a smile, looking away. “Nothing.”

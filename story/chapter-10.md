Title: "Chapter 10 – Digging into Bob"
---

The villa felt colder after Bob’s departure, as if his presence had drained the warmth out of the air. No one spoke until Renee finally broke the silence, her knuckles white around the polaroid.

“We can’t just ignore this,” she said. “Bob knows too much about the brooch, about my mother. Why would he even say someone here is lying unless he meant it?”

Claudia scoffed, folding her arms. “Because that’s what he does plays mind games. He’s the town’s paranoid watchdog. He spies on everyone, twists the truth, makes you doubt yourself.”

“Or,” Michelle said quietly, “he’s the one who’s been spying all along. Maybe he’s the one who recorded me... the one who sent that email.”

Tamika frowned. “Then why confront you in person? Why not just keep hiding?”

Michelle didn’t answer right away. Her gaze dropped to the floor, her thoughts circling the same conclusion: whoever Bob was covering for... or accusing had to be closer than they imagined.

The next day, the four of them gathered at Michelle’s apartment. Coffee cups lined the table, untouched. The weight of the night before still lingered.

Tamika opened her laptop, pulling up old university records. “If Bob was Julian’s teacher, there has to be a trace. A job posting, faculty history, something.”

Renee leaned over. “And we check his security files too. He works for Crest, right? Maybe there’s a trail.”

Michelle tapped her pen anxiously against her notebook. “We should also see if he’s connected to *madmax0142*. Same tone, same style. It fits, doesn’t it?”

Claudia’s voice was sharp. “Or maybe that’s what he wants you to think.”

For hours, they dug university archives, local council files, even some restricted databases Martha had once hinted she could access. Bits of Bob’s life began to form:

* **Former university lecturer**, specializing in digital systems and machine learning.
* **Shifted to Crest security work** six years ago after a scandal, rumors of surveillance misconduct on campus.
* **Unusually quiet personal life**, no family mentioned, no social connections anyone could find.

Tamika sat back, rubbing her temples. “So... he went from teaching code to running security. That explains how he’d know about hacking, cameras, surveillance.”

Michelle whispered, almost to herself, “And about how to manipulate evidence...”

For a moment, she zoned out. Her fingers tapped against the table, her eyes distant.

*“Please make it easier... and why you choose me to be the first girl to get you female torture fetish... I am pretty sure you did something more evil with Ramirez, that’s why she was always angry at you. But for now please make it easier for me.”*

“Mesh?” Tamika nudged her arm. Michelle blinked fast, then forced a smile. “Nothing. Just.. thinking too much.”

But Tamika didn’t look convinced.

Later that evening, Renee spoke up. “If Bob’s clean, why break into Claudia’s villa last night? Why take photos of us?”

The question hung heavy.

Michelle finally said it aloud: “Because either he’s the blackmailer... or he knows who is.”

A new message notification popped on Michelle’s phone. Her chest tightened as she unlocked it.

Another email.
From the same address: *[madmax0142@insertswork.net](mailto:madmax0142@insertswork.net)*

This time, no video. Just a single line:
**“You’re getting warmer.”**

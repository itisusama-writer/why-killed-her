Title: "Chapter 12 – The Second Message"
---

The apartment was silent except for the faint hum of Michelle’s old fan. The four girls sat around the table, the glow of Michelle’s phone screen turning their faces pale.

The newest email still lingered in their minds:
**Closer.**
The attached photo taken just minutes ago still burned in their vision.

“This isn’t random,” Renee said finally, her voice breaking. “He’s not just watching. He’s following us.”

Claudia pushed her hair back, frustrated. “So what’s the game? What does he even want?”

As if in answer, Michelle’s phone buzzed again. Another email.

Subject: **“Proof.”**

Tamika swallowed hard. “Don’t open it.”

Michelle did anyway.

This time it wasn’t just a picture. It was a video. Grainy, jittery, but unmistakable.

The four of them, at Timber Hall, peering through the door at Bob. Their whispers captured faintly: *“Is he… hacking something?”*

Then, a new overlay of text appeared across the screen:
**“You want answers? I want loyalty. Obey... or everyone will know what you did.”**

“What we did?” Claudia barked. “What the hell does that mean?”

Another buzz. A second message. This one with attachments: files named after each of them.

Renee’s fingers trembled as she clicked hers open. A scan of private text messages. Things she had only ever sent to Claudia in confidence.

“No…” Renee whispered, her hand clamping over her mouth. “These… these are mine.”

Michelle’s file was next. Photos of her walking alone at night, angles she’d never noticed anyone taking. One even showed her holding the bloody brooch in her hand, frozen mid-step.

Tamika’s file was shorter: her brothers, Reed and Carroll, photographed outside their building. A caption under one of the images read:
**“Accidents happen to families.”**

Tamika’s breath hitched.

Claudia’s was the last. A school disciplinary report she thought had been sealed. A fight, an injury, her name in bold.

Her voice dropped. “He’s got everything.”

Michelle pressed the phone down flat on the table, her hands shaking. “He’s not bluffing. Whoever this is, they’ve been inside our lives for weeks. Maybe months.”

“And now he wants what?” Tamika whispered.

Before anyone could answer, another message appeared.

This one was short. Just one line:
**“Tomorrow. Wallace Villa. Midnight. Come alone... or the world learns everything.”**

The room went still.

Claudia’s face hardened. “He’s pulling us back to my place.”

Michelle looked at the others, her pulse hammering in her ears. “Then that’s where we’ll find him. Or… whoever killed Miss Natalie.”

Michelle turned her phone face-down, staring into the dark window as if the Watcher could see her through it.

“Tomorrow… we end this,” she whispered.

And somewhere, unseen, a camera lens clicked.

Title: "Chapter 2 – Echoes of the Night"
---

Michelle groaned as sunlight stabbed through the blinds, throwing spears of gold across her face.

“My glasses... where the hell...” She patted blindly at her nightstand, under the pillow, under the covers, like a raccoon searching for treasure. Finally, her fingers snagged the frames jammed halfway under the pillowcase.

She shoved them on, squinted at her phone, and her stomach dropped. “Oh, no, no, no... it’s 1 p.m. I’m late. I’m dead.”

But just as she started panicking about missing her lecture, a notification buzzed:

**Sir Author** in the student chat: *“Class dismissed today. Sorry, students.”*

Michelle collapsed back onto the bed with a laugh. “Guess God exists... but only in my inbox.”

Shower, toast, coffee, and she was almost in a good mood. Sunlight poured through the window, bright and clean, promising an ordinary day.

Until Archie spoke.

“You know? Miss Moyer got murdered last night.” He said it like he was announcing the weather.

Michelle froze, toast halfway to her mouth. The words yanked her brain back blood, heels, brooch, the bag. Her hand trembled.

“Okay,” she muttered, standing so fast her chair scraped back. She bolted for her room, snatching her phone.

Ring. Ring.

“Mesh! Hey, how are you?” Tamika’s voice was soft, cheerful.

Michelle swallowed hard. “Timmy, I’m not okay.”

Instant concern. “What happened, baby? Tell me.”

“I can’t... not here. Not on the phone. Can I come over?”

“Yes. Hurry. Reed and Carroll are going out. I’ll be alone. Just come.”

On her way across Crest, Michelle nearly collided with **Melanie Hogan**, police incident commander, clipboard in hand, standing near black bags cordoned with tape.

“Hello, Miss Melanie,” Michelle offered, trying to sound casual.

The officer looked up, her face tight, serious. “Hello, child. Evidence from last night’s murder.” Her words were calm, heavy.

Michelle forced a smile. “Right. You do that. I’ll just... not get in your way.” She walked off fast, her thoughts clawing at her. *Evidence. Brooch. My purse.*

Her phone buzzed. **Tamika:** “Where are you??”
Michelle typed back: “C-Wing. Almost there.”

When Tamika opened the door, she didn’t waste time. She pulled Michelle into a hug, concern etched on her face.

“Professor Michelle,” Carroll teased from the dining room.

Michelle forced a smile. “Hey Carroll.”

Reed leaned against the wall. “We’re heading to a party with Julian and Archie. Don’t burn the house down.”

Michelle blinked. “Archie didn’t say a word about a party.”

“Classic Archie,” Reed shrugged. And they left.

In Tamika’s room, Michelle dropped her bag and sat, jittery. She opened her mouth then froze. Her purse had spilled, contents scattering. And there it was: the **golden brooch.** Dry blood along its edge.

Her breath hitched. She remembered last night stuffing it inside her bag in panic.

“Hey, why’d you stop?” Tamika’s eyes narrowed.

Michelle quickly scooped everything up, hiding the brooch. “Nothing. Just... lost my train of thought.”

“Mesh. Don’t play with me. Tell me everything.”

So Michelle did. She described walking home, the garbage bag, the shoes, the horror of it, everything except the brooch.

Tamika’s hands clenched. “You saw Mrs. Natalie? Dead? And you didn’t call the police?”

“I panicked! I didn’t even realize it was her until Archie said it this morning.”

Tamika exhaled sharply, shaking her head. “We can’t do anything now. Forget it.”

But then her eyes flicked to Michelle’s bag. “Wait. Why do you have Claudia’s brooch?”

Michelle froze. “...What?”

“She wears it all the time. In AP English Lit. Same design, same initials.”

Michelle’s pulse spiked. She pulled it out, staring at the bloody edge. “Promise me you won’t tell anyone. Please, Timmy. Promise.”

Tamika sighed, heavy. “Fine. I promise. But Michelle, this is insane. That’s *evidence*. Tampering with it makes you look guilty.”

Michelle paced, biting her nails. “If I go to the police, they’ll eat me alive with questions. Complicated, stupid, trap questions.”

“Then throw it away. Or hide it forever. Just don’t keep walking around with it!” Tamika snapped, her voice like a sister scolding.

Michelle slumped into a chair, muttering. “Great. Evidence in my bag, murderer maybe in my class, and Archie’s still making salads. Life really knows how to screw me.”

But outside their walls, the story wasn’t staying still.

A figure in a **black hoodie** sat in a dim room, replaying video footage on a bulky smartphone. Grainy but clear enough: a girl crouching near the garbage bag, pocketing something, running away.

“What the hell was she doing there?”

The figure zoomed in, uploaded the clip into face-recognition software. The machine whirred, scanning.

A face appeared.

**MICHELLE JOSEPH WIllIAM EDWARD CONLEY.**

The hooded figure leaned back, smirking. “Found you.”
